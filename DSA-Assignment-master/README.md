# Tested on:
Ubuntu 16.04
gcc (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.10) 5.4.0 20160609

# Running instructions:
To run, simply run make in the root directory.
Ensure that an empty build directory exists in the parent directory.

# Directory Layout:
The parent directory contains three subdirectories:
src/ - contains all the source code (.c files)
include/ - contains all the header files (.h files)
build/ - stores all the intermediate object files (.o files)
The main executable is created in the parent directory, and is called *memory*.

# More details:
Further development, if required, will be carried out at https://github.com/geckods/DSA-Assignment, which will be made public well after the submission deadline. My development history will also be available there.
